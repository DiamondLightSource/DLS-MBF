A New Transverse and Longitudinal Bunch by Bunch Feedback Processor

Michael Abbott, Guenther Rehm, Isa Uzun

We describe the development of firmware to support Longitudinal Bunch by Bunch
Feedback at Diamond Light source.  As well as feedback, the system supports
complex experiments and the capture of detailed diagnostics.  In this paper we
describe the firmware development and some details of the processing chain.  We
focus on some of the challenges of FPGA development from the perspective of a
software engineer.  Another interesting challenge was posed by the decision to
develop the entire signal processing chain to run at 500 MHz.  This does work
well enough, but presents numerous challenges; it would probably have been
simpler to run at half the clock speed!
