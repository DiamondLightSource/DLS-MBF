\begin{abstract}

We describe the development of firmware to support Longitudinal Bunch by Bunch
Feedback at Diamond Light source.  As well as feedback, the system supports
complex experiments and the capture of detailed electron beam diagnostics.  In
this paper we describe the firmware development and some details of the
processing chain.  We focus on some of the challenges of FPGA development from
the perspective of a software engineer.

\section{Introduction}

At Diamond Light Source (DLS) we have been working on multi-bunch feedback for
more than a decade~\cite{dipac2007, epac2008, biw2010, icalepcs2011, ibic2013,
ibic2014, icalepcs2015}, this work being originally based on developments at the
ESRF~\cite{epac2006}.  Up to now our work has been based on the Libera
bunch-by-bunch platform \cite{libera}, which is now obsolete and has limited
capacity for further developments --- at the time of writing the Virtex-II Pro
FPGA at the heart of the Libera processor is 15 years old.  With this platform
we have focused on stabilising and measuring only transverse instabilities.

More recently we have been asked to provide support for measurement and
stabilisation of longitudinal multi-bunch instabilities as part of an ongoing
project to install normally conducting RF cavities~\cite{ipac2017rf}.  It is
anticipated that these may introduce longitudinal resonances and instabilities
which will need to be managed.

We have therefore been working on a project to upgrade our TMBF (Transverse
Multi-Bunch Feedback) system to run on more modern hardware and to add
longitudinal capabilities to the system, so creating an LMBF (Longitudinal
Multi-Bunch Feedback) processor.  We have already reported~\cite{ibic2016} on
our preliminary work on the new system and on the choice of hardware; we'll
discuss this further below.

In this paper we will describe the architecture of the new LMBF (Longitudinal
Multi-Bunch Feedback) processor based on our chosen hardware, and discuss some
of the lessons learned during this development.  From a software engineering
perspective, development of a complex FPGA system presents some remarkable
challenges, which we'll also discuss.

The development of our new LMBF processor was driven by two motivations: to
ensure that we are ready for any new longitudinal instabilities, and to increase
the capabilities of our existing system~\cite{ipac2017rf, ibic2016}.  We also
wanted to improve our knowledge and understanding of high speed processing
hardware relevant to synchrotron diagnostics.

We started with an investigation to determine the appropriate hardware platform
for this kind of development.  Early on it was decided that we would need a
powerful FPGA with FMC (FPGA Mezzanine Card) support.  Initially we looked at
self contained FPGA platforms, and even briefly considered creating our own, but
in the end we converged on MicroTCA~\cite{mtca}.  This platform provides us with
a wide choice of crates and AMC (ATCA Mezzanine Card) processing modules with
high speed interconnect.  The same platform is being used for a joint
development with ALBA of digital low level RF~\cite{ipac2017llrf}.

Having selected MicroTCA as our platform we then selected the following
hardware.  Figure \ref{fmc500} shows the digital processing hardware assembled
ready for insertion in the MicroTCA crate.

\begin{Description}
\item[FMC-500M]
    (HPC) High Pin Count FMC providing dual channel 500\,MS/s 14-bit ADC and
    dual channel 1230\,MS/s 16-bit DAC~\cite{fmc500}.  This will support
    bunch-by-bunch operation at our machine RF frequency of 500\,MHz, and can be
    driven by our machine clock.
\item[FmcDIO5chTTLa]
    Five port digital IO FMC~\cite{fmcdio}.  This is used for miscellaneous
    triggering and other signals.
\item[AMC525]
    Double width AMC card with two HPC FMC slots, 2\,GB of fast on board DRAM
    and 128\,MB of slower DRAM connected to a Virtex-7 690 FPGA, supporting an 8
    lane gen3 PCIe connection over the MicroTCA backplane~\cite{amc525}.  This
    is where all the FPGA firmware will run, and the fast backplane connection
    will allow us to do a lot of data processing in the associated CPU.
\item[AMC720]
    This is an AMC card with an Intel Xeon processor with ample memory and
    sufficient local storage.  We install Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 on this,
    and run our control system and any associated signal processing.
\item[VT814]
    This is a 2U MicroTCA chassis with 6 AMC slots and dual redundant power
    supplies.
\end{Description}



\section{Functionality and Design}

\subsection{Functionality}

The bunch-by-bunch processor has two functions: to stabilise coupled bunch
oscillations of the electron beam, and to provide diagnostics functions for
measuring beam behaviour and detailed parameters.

Bunch oscillation is stabilised by a feedback filter applied to each bunch to
generate feedback at around 180\textdegree{} out of phase.

For diagnostics our processor provides the following features:
\begin{Itemize}
\item
    Capture of up to 2\,GB of two channels of 500\,MS/s data, selectable from
    different processing stages.  This allows the capture of bunch by bunch
    behaviour and feedback channels.
\item
    Multiple Numerically Controlled Oscillators (NCOs) for driving excitation
    onto the beam.  This is used for tune measurement and grow damp experiments.
\item
    Detectors for capturing IQ data by mixing an NCO with the beam response.
    Outputs from the detectors are written to slow memory and can be used for
    tune measurement and other experiments.
\item
    Programmable sequencer for programming a sequence of NCO frequencies and
    controlling the behaviour of the detectors.
\item
    Individual bunch controls.  For each bunch a different excitation and
    different feedback filter can be selected.  This allows us to perform tune
    measurement on a chosen set of bunches, and to have a different feedback
    filter for a hybrid bunch.
\end{Itemize}

Diagnostics experiments are performed by programming the bunch controls, the
available filters and the sequencer, and then the sequencer is triggered.
Measurements are then written to slow memory and then read out and processed by
the control system.


\subsection{System Design}

Figure \ref{overview} shows the signal processing chain as implemented in the
current design.  This is similar to the existing TMBF as reported
earlier~\cite{icalepcs2015}.  The main enhancements so far (work is still in
progress) are the improved bunch by bunch motion measurement, longer FIR filters
throughout, and rate change to support longitudinal processing.

There are two memory capture targets, MEM\textsubscript0 used for dual channel
full data rate capture, configured as a 2\,GB circular buffer, and
MEM\textsubscript1 used for detector capture, configured as two separate 64\,MB
blocks.


\subsection{Longitudinal vs Transverse Processing}

There is not too much difference in the processing required for longitudinal vs
transverse bunch by bunch feedback --- the biggest differences is in the output
drive chain after the DAC, as described in~\cite{ibic2016}.  However, there are
a few differences that are important to our system.

\begin{Itemize}
\item
    Operation is on beam phase.  We operate on a phase adjusted intensity signal
    as a proxy for phase.  We will take two channels $I$ and $Q$ of input at
    90\textdegree{} phase separation, but the overall phase will be controlled
    to drive one channel, $Q$, as close to zero as possible, and this will be
    taken as our input signal.
\item
    Output will be used to drive a mixer, and for efficiency we will want to use
    an IQ mixer driven with signals separated by 90\textdegree{}.
\item
    The synchrotron tune (longitudinal oscillation frequency) is a low fraction
    of the machine revolution frequency, in our case typically around 0.004.
    This will require a substantial frequency shift (by down and up sampling).
\end{Itemize}

Despite these differences, we are able to write the same software and firmware
to implement both longitudinal and transverse multi-bunch processing.  The only
extra firmware support required beyond the down/up sample support is some data
cross-bars between parts of the two data channels.


\section{Implementation}


\subsection{Interconnect}

\begin{figure}
\begin{centering}
\input{THPHA115f3.tikz}
\end{centering}
\squarecaption{Interconnect between PCI Express core (PCIe), memory (DRAM), and
the LMBF data processor (DSP).}
\label{interconnect}
\end{figure}

After the ``Hello World'' step of getting flashing LEDs, the very first
development was of what we've called the ``Interconnect''.  This part of the
system glues together all of the core resources provided by the FPGA carrier
card to provide a basic environment for the development of the rest of the
system.

Figure \ref{interconnect} illustrates the basic structure of the interconnect.
The register interface is used by the control system to manage the rest of the
processing chain (referred to as DSP here), a simple interrupt controller, and a
DMA engine for transferring data from DRAM to processor memory.

This part of the FPGA design was constructed using the Vivado Block Design
editor, which is a graphical tool for configuring and linking Xilinx components
into a complete design.  The AXI bus is used to connect all of the components.
The rest of the system is written in VHDL.


\subsection{Kernel Driver}

A dedicated kernel driver manages the interface from the processor to this part
of the core FPGA system.  The DSP registers are available to be mapped into
memory, whereas the DMA and interrupt control registers are managed by the
driver only.  This allows for separation between the constantly evolving system
interface, running in user space, and the fixed interrupt and memory management.
Also, it is helpful to separate out the memory and interrupt management, as this
part of the system is able to crash or otherwise compromise the behaviour of the
control processor.

The kernel driver presents three device nodes to userspace, one for mapping
registers into memory and receiving interrupt events, and two for memory readout
(the AMC525 provides two banks of DRAM).  The design and implementation of this
driver has remained unchanged since the start of the project.


\subsection{Top Level System Design}

The FPGA design is structured into the interconnect described above
(Fig.~\ref{interconnect}), interfaces to the two FMC cards, two channels of
feedback processing (DSP), and a shared register control interface.  Four banks
of registers provide control over:
\begin{Itemize}
\item
    System level registers for clock management and FMC-500 control and setup.
\item
    Control registers for resources shared between the two DSP channels
    including triggering and fast capture to memory.
\item
    Two banks of registers, one dedicated to each DSP channel.
\end{Itemize}

A custom software tool is used to manage the list of register assignments.  From
a central list of registers and fields, VHDL definitions, C \texttt{struct}
definitions, and documentation are automatically generated.  This makes it
straightforward to add remove or rearrange registers, which is otherwise
laborious and error prone.


\subsection{FMC-500 Configuration}

An initial challenge to getting the FMC-500 up and running was that the
documentation for the card~\cite{fmc500} was lacking in important detail; I
understand that the normal application for this component is as part of a vendor
supplied system.  However, the manufacturer was very helpful in answering my
questions and providing the missing pieces.

The FMC-500 is built from three key devices, a PLL clock controller (LMK04828),
a dual channel ADC (AD9684), and a dual channel DAC (AD9122), each of which is
controlled by a dedicated SPI interface.  The ADC and DAC are straightforward to
configure (the DAC is somewhat more complex), but the PLL controller is very
complex.

A Python script captures the complex register interface to the LMK04828 and is
run on the processor during system startup.


\subsection{Signal Processing Chain}

Most of the LMBF signal processing chain was taken from our last TMBF
design~\cite{icalepcs2015}, but nevertheless there has been a lot of rework.
The most important changes to the original design include the following:

\begin{Itemize}
\item
    Beam motion measurement now also measures mean beam position and standard
    deviation of motion.
\item
    Bunch by bunch down and up sampling is now part of the bunch-by-bunch FIR.
    This is needed for LMBF support to support the very low synchrotron tune
    number.
\item
    There are now multiple detectors with individual bunch enables on each
    detector.
\item
    Cross-bars are provided at key points in the signal processing chain to
    support IQ processing for LMBF feedback and excitation.
\end{Itemize}


\subsection{EPICS Driver}

The control system runs on the dedicated processor card and provides an EPICS
interface to all aspects of the system.  User interface screens are built using
EDM.


\section{Development Challenges}

\subsection{FPGA Culture Shock}

Coming to FPGA development as a software engineer is a real culture shock.  The
huge differences in semantic model are interesting, but really this is the
smallest issue.  The main challenges are two fold.

Firstly, the state of the art in Hardware Definition Languages (HDLs) is very
weak.  The mainstream languages (VHDL, Verilog, SystemVerilog) all suffer from
very poor abstraction, mismatch between language and target, and excessive
verbosity (VHDL especially).  There does seem to be some work on alternatives,
but unfortunately we come to the second challenge.

All FPGA development is strongly and inextricably tied to vendor tools.  The
general philosophy is that \emph{everything} is licensed.  All components
are referred to as ``IP'' (Intellectual Property), and encryption is widespread.
The whole environment is inimical to open source development and sharing.

In the Accelerator and Large Experimental Physics community we rely on
intellectual sharing for reuse and shared development.  From a management
perspective, sharing is important to help manage the risks associated with the
mismatch between the relatively brief lifetime of modern technology, and the
extended lifetime of large facilities.


\subsection{Development Cycle}

Three challenges stand out in the development cycle: source control, build
times, and debugging.

For source control it is important to separate built from edited files, and it
is desirable to store source files in a format which is friendly to diff.
Although this can be done with the Xilinx Vivado development tool, this process
goes against the grain of the tool.  The tool does support scripted development,
but the process is surprisingly fragile.

The build process is extraordinarily slow, particularly in comparison with
compiling a software language.  The process is certainly more complex, and in
particular the placement and routing of resources on the FPGA is difficult.

Debugging FPGA code is more laborious than debugging software, in particular it
is much more difficult to inspect what is going on inside the device, and the
slow build process makes debugging by instrumentation not very practical.
Instead, debugging is mostly done through simulation, and there are some very
sophisticated and complex simulation tools available to complement the
development process.


\subsection{Running at 500\,MHz}

In the previous TMBF design we operated with 4 lanes of digital processing with
an FPGA clock of 125\,MHz.  Implementing this makes for some clumsy
complications in the firmware, so when I discovered that the our new FPGA
supports 500\,MHz operation I was tempted, and reworked the design for single
lane operation.  This might have been unwise.

According to Xilinx documentation, any 7-series FPGA of speed grade 2 supports
500\,MHz operation of the key components, block memory, and DSP units.  However,
there are two main challenges.

The first obstacle was rather unexpected: when allowing Vivado to infer block
memory assignment (the normal way of using this resource), it turns out that the
tool automatically configures the memory in a slower mode of operation which is
not compatible with full speed operation.  This was fixed with an explicit mode
overwrite in the FPGA constraints.

The second obstacle is that achieving timing closure is very hard, and is very
brittle against any changes in the code.  It seems that the component placement
state of the development tool is not well optimised for 500\,MHz placement, and
it needs a lot of manual guidance.  So far this has been done using ``pblocks''
which are used to restrict where certain parts of the design are placed on the
device.


\section{Conclusions}

Development of the new TMBF and LMBF system has been very instructive, and will
provide DLS and other projects with enhanced bunch-by-bunch feedback and
diagnostics capabilities.  We are looking to share this development with other
facilities, and have seen interest from BESSY~II and from ESRF.

We will be extending the diagnostic capabilities of the system described here
with further filtering, with more excitation and detection options, and with
other improvements to be determined.
