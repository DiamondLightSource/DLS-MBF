\begin{abstract}

We describe the development of firmware to support Longitudinal Bunch by Bunch
Feedback at Diamond Light source.  As well as feedback, the system supports
complex experiments and the capture of detailed diagnostics.  In this paper we
describe the firmware development and some details of the processing chain.  We
focus on some of the challenges of FPGA development from the perspective of a
software engineer.  Another interesting challenge was posed by the decision to
develop the entire signal processing chain to run at 500\,MHz.  This does work
well enough, but presents numerous challenges; it would probably have been
simpler to run at half the clock speed!

\section{Introduction}

At Diamond Light Source (DLS) we have been working on multi-bunch feedback for
more than a decade~\cite{dipac2007, epac2008, biw2010, icalepcs2011, ibic2013,
ibic2014, icalepcs2015}, this work being originally based on developments at the
ESRF~\cite{epac2006}.  Up to now our work has been based on the Libera platform
\cite{libera}, which is now obsolete and has limited capacity for further
developments --- at the time of writing the Virtex-II Pro FPGA at the heart of
the Libera processor is 15 years old.  Up to now we have focused on stabilising
and measuring only transverse instabilities.

More recently we have been asked to provide support for measurement and
stabilisation of longitudinal multi-bunch instabilities as part of an ongoing
project to install normally conducting RF cavities~\cite{ipac2017rf}.  It is
anticipated that these may introduce extra resonances and instabilities which
will need special treatment.

We have therefore been working on a project to upgrade our TMBF (Transverse
Multi-Bunch Feedback) system to run on more modern hardware and to add
longitudinal capabilities to the system, so creating an LMBF (Longitudinal
Multi-Bunch Feedback) processor.  We have already reported~\cite{ibic2016} on
our preliminary work on the new system and on the choice of hardware; we'll
discuss this further below.

In this paper we will describe the architecture of the new LMBF (Longitudinal
Multi-Bunch Feedback) processor based on our chosen hardware, and discuss some
of the lessons learned during this development.  From a software engineering
perspective, development of a complex FPGA system presents some remarkable
challenges, which we'll also discuss.


\section{Hardware Platform}

\end{figure*}



As noted above, the development of our new LMBF processor was driven by two
motivations: to ensure that we are ready for any new longitudinal instabilities,
and to increase the capabilities of our existing system~\cite{ipac2017rf,
ibic2016}.  We also wanted to improve our knowledge and understanding of high
speed processing hardware relevant to synchrotron diagnostics.

We started with an investigation to determine the appropriate hardware platform
for this kind of development.  Early on it was decided that we would need a
powerful FPGA with FMC (FPGA Mezzanine Card) support.  Initially we looked at
self contained FPGA platforms, and even briefly considered creating our own, but
in the end we converged on MicroTCA~\cite{mtca}.  This platform provides us with
a wide choice of crates and AMC (ATCA Mezzanine Card) processing modules with
high speed interconnect, and turns out to be compatible with a concurrent
development at DLS to develop Low Level RF with ALBA~\cite{ipac2017llrf}.

Having selected MicroTCA as our platform we then selected the following
hardware:

\begin{description}
\item[FMC-500M]
    (HPC) High Pin Count FMC providing dual channel 500\,MS/s 14-bit ADC and
    dual channel 1230\,MS/s 16-bit DAC~\cite{fmc500}.  This will support
    bunch-by-bunch operation at our machine RF frequency of 500\,MHz, and can be
    driven by our machine clock.
\item[FmcDIO5chTTLa]
    Five port digital IO FMC~\cite{fmcdio}.  This is used for miscellaneous
    triggering and other signals.
\item[AMC525]
    Double width AMC card with two HPC FMC slots, 2\,GB of fast on board DRAM,
    connected to a Virtex-7 690 FPGA, supporting an 8 lane gen3 PCIe connection
    over the MicroTCA backplane~\cite{amc525}.  This is our workhorse where all
    the FPGA firmware will run, and the fast backplane connection will allow us
    to do a lot of data processing in the associated CPU.
\item[AMC720]
    This is an AMC card with an Intex Xeon processor with ample memory and
    sufficient local storage.  We install Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 on this,
    and run our control system and any associated signal processing.
\item[VT814]
    This is a 2U MicroTCA chassis with 6 AMC slots and dual redundant power
    supplies.
\end{description}

Fig \ref{fmc500} shows the digital processing hardware assembled ready for
insertion in the MicroTCA crate.


\section{System Design}

Fig \ref{overview} shows the signal processing chain as implemented in the
current design.  This is not so very different from figure 3 of our
ICALEPCS~2015 paper~\cite{icalepcs2015}.  The main enhancements are the improved
bunch by bunch motion measurement, longer FIR filters throughout, and rate
change to support longitudinal processing.
