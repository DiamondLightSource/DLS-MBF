At Diamond Light Source we compute the horizontal and vertical tunes by fitting
a simple multi-pole resonator model to the measured electron beam frequency
response.  The transverse (and longitudinal) tune response is measured by
sweeping an excitation across the range of possible tune frequencies and
synchronously measuring the IQ response.

The multi-pole resonator model is a good physical fit to the measured behaviour,
but the fitting process is surprisingly challenging.  Problems include noisy
measurements, very complex beam responses in the presence of increasing
chromaticity, poor data when the beam is close to instability, and a number of
challenges with the stability of the algorithm.

The tune fitting algorithm now in use at Diamond has been developed and refined
over many years.  It is finally stable enough to work reliably throughout most
beam operating conditions.  The algorithm involves alternating peak finding and
non-linear fitting, with a fairly naive mathematical approach; the main focus is
on providing reliable results.
