There are a number of unresolved problems in the current implementation of the
kernel driver.

Hot plug management
-------------------

I am told that when removal of the AMC525 is initiated through the front panel
switch the kernel driver should be automatically unloaded.  We do not see this
behaviour.  One theory is that our kernel (RHEL7) does not support this event,
another is that our MCH (Vadatech) does not.

In either case, if the AMC525 is unloaded while a PCIe transation is in progress
then the CPU card is likely to generate a kernel panic.

Device detection on startup
---------------------------

At DLS we find that either the CPU must be rebooted at least once after the FPGA
has been loaded, or the rescan-pcie program must be run.  At the ESRF (running
Debian) this behaviour is not observed, so this may be a kernel issue.

The rescan-pcie command is not altogether save, I have observed it leaving the
FPGA in a state where a reload was required.

Upgrading the Kernel Driver
---------------------------

Alas, it would seem that dkms and rpm work together to make upgrading the kernel
driver an unreliable procedure.  I am finding that `rpm -U` leaves the
installation in an inconsistent state, where the new driver source is installed,
but the old version of the driver is left installed in /lib/modules.

A little bit of digging into dkms reveals that the version check during upgrade
ignores the actual version info if the sources are identical, which is not
really what we want.
